Calico
======
Calico in its current state is mostly a library for exploring and storing
information pulled from shapefiles. There's all kinds of little bricks to 
work with and you can easily compose them into higher level functionality.

Apart from being pretty useful for dealing with shapefiles (and the store
backend) from the command line it also functions as a way in order to see
(and hopefully demonstrate) how powerful its functional command pattern 
implementation can be.
