We'll start by seeing how we can use the included command line client in
order to perform useful tasks that deal with shapefiles and extracting and
analyzing the data inside. From there we'll slowly dive into the deeper

understanding of how loosely coupled everything is and how easily existing
pieces can be composed into new and more powerful features without losing
any information.
