Intro
=====
Calico is a GeoJSON server and general GIS sandboxing project.

Testing out source code blocks.

.. code-block:: powershell

    Get-Clients

And this should be normal text again. We can also *scan* shapefiles
and see what information we recognize:

.. code-block:: powershell

    Resolve-Shapefile .\path\to\shapefile.dbf

And this should give us some information about the number of features
and whether we could find a matching feature type and plot in the database.
